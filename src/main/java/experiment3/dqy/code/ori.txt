a data structure models some abstract object. it implements a number of operations on this object, which usually can be classified into
creation and deletion operations, update operations, and query operations. in the case of the dictionary, we want to create or delete the set itself, update the
set by inserting or deleting elements, and query for the existence of an element in the set. once it has been created, the object is changed by the update operations.
the query operations do not change the abstract object, although they might change the representation of the object in the data structure: this is called an
adaptive data structure  it adapts to the query to answer future similar queries faster.
data structures that allow updates and queries are called dynamic data structures. there are also simpler structures that are created just once for
some given object and allow queries but no updates; these are called static data structures. dynamic data structures are preferable because they are more
general, but we also need to discuss static structures because they are useful as building blocks for dynamic structures, and, for some of the more complex
objects we encounter, no dynamic structure is known. we want to find data structures that realize a given abstract object and are
fast. the size of structures is another quality measure, but it is usually of less importance. to express speed, we need a measure of comparison; this is the
size of the underlying object, not our representation of that object. notice that a long sequence of update operations can still result in a small object.
